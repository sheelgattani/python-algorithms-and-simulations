A few basic Python algorithms to start out


#1)Prime Factorization Program
This Python program factorizes a given number into its prime factors using a simple trial division method. It repeatedly divides the number by increasing integers starting from 2, stores each factor found in a list, and continues until the number becomes 1. The program also measures and prints the time taken to complete the factorization using the time module.

#2)Fibonacci Series Program
This Python program generates a Fibonacci sequence using either a recursive or iterative method, based on the user’s choice. It prints the first n terms of the sequence and measures the execution time for the selected approach using the time module, allowing a basic performance comparison between recursion and iteration.

#3)Credit Card Validator Program
This Python program validates a 16-digit credit card number using the Luhn algorithm. It processes the digits from right to left, doubles every alternate digit, adjusts values greater than 9, and computes a total sum. If the total is divisible by 10, the card number is declared valid; otherwise, it is invalid.

#4)Coin Flip Simulator Program
This Python program simulates flipping a coin n times using random numbers. It counts the number of Heads and Tails, calculates their experimental probabilities, and then visualizes the results with a bar chart using matplotlib.
